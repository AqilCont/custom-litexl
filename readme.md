# My custom lite-xl plugins
these are lite-xl plugins that I've modified to my liking, or created for my own purposes.

Most are just mods, but there is one of note. 

linter.lua is modified to support LSP diagnostics. To enable this, simply put linter.lua and lintplus.lua in your plugins folder.

Note: DO NOT install any linters meant for lintplus, they will not work with this modded linter plugin.

my init.lua is also here.

enjoy :)
